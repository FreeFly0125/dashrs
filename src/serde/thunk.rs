/// One might wonder why this enum exists, and why we don't simply reuse
/// [`Error`](::serde::de::error::Error). The main reason is that I do not want to include variants
/// in that enum that do not occur during the actual deserialization phase. The second reason has to
/// do with lifetimes: Just using `Error<'a>` for the return type in the [`ThunkContent`] functions
/// used by [`Thunk`] is not possible. The reason for that is that processing errors are returned in
/// contexts where data is transformed into owned representations. This means we cannot simply reuse
/// the lifetime the input data is bound to for our errors, as the errors potentially have to
/// outlive the input data (in the worst case they have to be `'static`). Adding a new lifetime to
/// `Thunk` just to use that for the error type is obviously impractical, however it is possible to
/// use `Error<'static>`, which at least doesn't add more downsides. However it still leaves us with
/// an error enum dealing with too much stuff.
